Qusic – Quantum Cosmic Music Generator

"Hearing the music of cosmos”

Qusic is a fun and creative project that turns quantum randomness from photons into cosmic-sounding music using a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG).
It’s where physics meets sound and the universe plays the melody!

How It Works ⚙️

Photons are detected using a custom QRNG setup 🔦

Their quantum randomness is turned into numbers 🎲

These numbers are then mapped to musical notes 🎼

You get a unique, unpredictable, spacey melody every time!

Why Qusic? ✨

> “If the universe had a soundtrack, this might be it.”



Qusic is inspired by:

The mystery of the cosmos

The beauty of quantum mechanics

The emotion of sound


It’s not just a project — it’s a vibe. A way to hear the randomness of the universe.
